            Musicians like to mingle. They collaborate, change bands, cover each others songs and share producers.
            Six degrees of separation explores these links, by suggesting six albums all linked to each other by real world events. Starting from your chosen album,
            the next suggestion could be linked by a guitarist that played in both bands, a producer that worked on both albums, or acts that performed together onstage. The possibilities are endless.
            Opening a panorama of potential links; spanning different artists, genres or points in time; our six degrees are all routed in this exciting world of interlinking unities.
