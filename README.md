# Vinyl Tracer 

### What's Vinyl Tracer about?

Loving rifling vinyl in your local independent record store, but not always able to get there? We can spin those stacks for you, to help you unearth those unexpected treasures right here. Using our unique **Six Degrees of Separation** searches, we'll come up with new-old record discoveries, wild cards, and hidden gems. All based on real life links between the artists. Not a computer 'sounds like' algorithm in sight. 	:man_dancing:

### Who made this amazing app?

Music lovers and tech dreamers, [Liz Tobin](https://github.com/lizmtobin), [Gideon Berridge](https://github.com/GidBerridge), and [Clare Amos](https://github.com/Architravelt) developed this web app as their final project on a Web Development Bootcamp at Le Wagon - the world's most acclaimed tech bootcamp! 

Our tech stack for this app is **HTML, CSS, SASS, Javascript, Ruby On Rails, Postgres & Heroku** 

### Tell me more about your process...

With our mission to bring the serendipity of the record store to the internet, we began by considering the potential persona who would value this app, mapped out the *User Story* and then moved quickly to create a mock-up version of our product in Figma. Check out the prototype below :point_down: 

Once happy with the prototype we started to build-out our schema to model the data, establish the routing with MVC principles and design the frontend. Finally, we deployed to the web via Heroku.

### Keeping Lean
Working in an Agile team, we pivoted towards the creation of an algorithm which would recommend related albums based on the tangible relationships between artists. This idea ignited our curiosity and spawned the *Six Degrees of Spearation* feature which defines the finished product.
